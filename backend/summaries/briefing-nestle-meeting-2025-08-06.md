## RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:** Lack of detailed project notes from previous meetings hinders tailored approach. ‚Ä¢ Limited information on Joshnaacsha's role within Nestl√© may lead to unfocused conversation. ‚Ä¢ Without a meeting description, we lack a clear objective and agenda.

**üöÄ Opportunities:** Position Cprime as a trusted advisor to Nestl√©, leveraging our expertise in digital transformation and cloud migration. ‚Ä¢ Identify specific areas where Cprime can provide immediate value, leading to a potential pilot project. ‚Ä¢ If Joshnaacsha is not the key decision-maker, use the opportunity to network and identify the relevant stakeholders.
