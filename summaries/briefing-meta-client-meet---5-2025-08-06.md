## RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:** Meta's internal expertise in cloud migration and data management might limit our scope. ‚Ä¢ Potential for budget constraints or competing priorities within Meta's large organization. ‚Ä¢ Neo4j version compatibility issues (Vector Index requires 5.18+) could create unexpected roadblocks.

**üöÄ Opportunities:** Position Cprime as a strategic partner for Meta's long-term cloud and AI/ML strategy. ‚Ä¢ Expand engagement beyond initial cloud migration to include DevOps/CI/CD and data engineering services. ‚Ä¢ Explore opportunities to integrate our solutions with Meta's existing ecosystem of tools and platforms (e.g., Confluence, internal APIs).
