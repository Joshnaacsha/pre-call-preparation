## üè¢ CLIENT OVERVIEW

Ford Motor Company is undergoing a large-scale cloud migration to modernize its IT infrastructure, enable data-driven vehicle systems, and improve scalability. Cprime is a key consulting partner facilitating this transformation.

## üìä PROJECT STATUS & HISTORY

### Past Engagement Summary
Previous meetings focused on initial discovery, technical planning, dry run review, and execution of the telemetry pipeline and Support API backend migration. The migration went smoothly, although a slight delay in DNS propagation was observed in the APAC region. Post-cutover monitoring and user acceptance testing (UAT) are underway.

### Current Project Status  
The current meeting is a follow-up to the production cutover of the Telemetry pipeline and Support API backend. The primary focus is to review the post-migration performance, discuss user acceptance testing results, and prepare for the success review.

## üåê EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE

External research indicates a past DNS resolution failure in Ford's Asia Pacific region (July 9, 2023). This may be relevant to the observed DNS propagation delay during the recent migration. Cprime's 24/7 support and monitoring capabilities, as well as our expertise in Platform Reliability & Security, are crucial for mitigating such issues and ensuring a smooth user experience.
